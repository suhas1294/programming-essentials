The function does the following:
1. fetches given number of articles from api
2. Sort the fetched articles in descnding order of number of comments the article have received.
3. articles without title has to be ignored
4. articles with number of comments as null or empty has to be ignored.
5. if both articles have same number of comments, then they have to be sorted alphabetically.

output is array of strings where a string represents :\
"<number_of_comments>\<space>\<title_of_article>"

input example(running command frmo terminal):\
