//check if sum is zero in Linked list

/* 
    step 1: Merge sort an LinkedLIst (n log n)
    step 2: Populate all negative numbers in a stack (n)
    step 3: Traverse through all positive ints and peek if (-1)*(positive int) exist in array
    step 4: Using two pointer: peek if (-1) * (sum of any two ints) exists in stack
