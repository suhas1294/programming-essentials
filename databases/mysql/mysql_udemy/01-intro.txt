'database' and 'database management system' both are different.

database is a place where data is stored.

'mysq, postgres, oracle etc' are 'dbms' which are use to talk to 'databases'

SQL vs MySQL:
    mysql, postgres, oracle, sqlite all uses 'SQL'(structured query language) which is a standard query language.
    'SQL' is a standard used by above dbms.

what makes dbms unique is the features they offer not the language(sql), bcoz language is anyway same. features like :
    - how secure is one vs the other
    - how fast is it
    - how big it is to download
    - use permission to work

installation:
    vi ~/.zshrc
    export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin

    mysql -u root -p
    kbd&^%ruyf3qe (autogenerate password for first time)

    alter user 'root'@'localhost' identified by '<newpassword>';

inside a single database server(host) there can be multiple databases;
